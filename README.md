# xcom2-wotc-modlist
My modlist for XCOM 2 War Of The Chosen.

My last playthrough was with slightly different mods and worked well, except it was kind of laggy. I removed a couple of mods, switched to the alternative mod launcher and the laggyness is gone. I haven't completed a playthrough with this yet, so this mod list is only partially tested.

Most of the mods are bugfixes and quality of life stuff like a better squad select screen, scanning times being shown in hours when under two days, a loadout manager for gear and better line of sight indicators, the black market telling you if you might still need bodies before selling them, showing hitpoints as a number so you don't have to count the 50+ pips of a late game chosen, using different colors to show you which abilities are turn ending.

The two mods I recently added and haven't properly tested yet are
- [WOTC] Detailed Soldier Lists Redux
- [WOTC] Gotcha Again Redux

Gotcha might be the most important quality of life mod with its improved line of sight indicators. So far Gotcha Again Redux seems to work better than the pre-redux I was using before. I'm not sure about the peek from cover stuff it does. That can be turned off in settings, though (when using Mod Config Menu).

Some of the mods affect gameplay in a way that affects difficulty and isn't a bugfix. I use them anyway, as I don't find them gamebreaking at all. Use them or not as you please.

- "DLC Breakthroughs Support" lets Alien Ruler armor be affected by appropriate armor research breakthroughs and SPARK weapons be affected by the cannon research breakthroughs Improved Cannons and
Modular Cannons. https://xcom.fandom.com/wiki/Breakthroughs_and_Inspirations#Armor
- "[WOTC] Trainable Sparks (and other Buffs)" lets SPARKs use the training center, gives them a PCS slot and an ammo pocket. Feel free to not use any of these options if you find it OP or turn the mod off altogether. I still don't use Sparks much in the endgame.
- "[WOTC] Purifier Grenades Fix" un-nerfs incendiary grenades used by the player while leaving Purifier grenades nerfed.
- "[WOTC] Reliable Wounds" removes the RNG from how long wounded soldiers need to heal. No more short and no more really long healing times.
- "[WOTC] Community Promotion Screen" is just QOL until you turn on to show all perks on unreached ranks, which I do. I hate it so much when I level up a soldier and then find out all their perks are useless. I want to know up front. This is the one setting I recommend changing using the Mod Config Menu. The rest seems fine on default settings.
- "Scientist Staff Slots: WotC Edition" allows the Restistance Ring, Infirmary and Psi lab to be staffed with scientists instead of engineers, making engineers less scarce.
- "WotC: "Increase Combat Intelligence" for everyone" allows you to send Faction heroes like Reapers on the covert op that increases their combat intelligence.
